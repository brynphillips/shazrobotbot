1. We need figure out a way to get spotify's authorization flow to work
in my bot for !song
    FallDownTS: I can think of a few things, it might not require
    authorization if you're already logged in, there might be a
    way to send the login info programatically so you could do
    it from code and the hardest way would be to use a headless
    browser from python and literally imitatate a user logging
    in, but I'm just guessing at this point

2. Possibly need to fix some of the !followage command
